I made this program for the 24h Innovation Labs 2022 hackathon. It takes as input coordinates and outputs the most viable plants for that location using information from a soil database and weather data. The weather data is collected using a python script that makes calls to an api from a weather data provider.
The folder "Code" contains only the code for easy access.
